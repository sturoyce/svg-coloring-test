# svg-coloring-test
Testing using React for a colouring app that lets you add your own SVGs to color.
It parses the SVG into a component tree and presents you a colorable version on the page with a custom colour picker.

Work in progress.

A test svg is included.
If you wish to use your own JPG (Or other bitmap) follow the below steps:

1. invert the black and white colouring image
2. upload image to your favourite SVG converter site.
3. select this SVG

This will all evenutally be built into the app.
